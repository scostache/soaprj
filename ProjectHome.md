HybFS

We are starting HybFS as a semester project for the Advanced Operating Systems course (Politehnica University of Bucharest). The main idea of this project is to have an overlay file system on Linux that can provide multiple organizational views of the same original hierarchy of files, without altering the interface for the existing applications. It is different from a true semantic file system because it still allows the orginial hierarhical view of files, therefore the name of "hybrid file system" - HybFS :) .


More details about this project are described on HybFS wiki.
