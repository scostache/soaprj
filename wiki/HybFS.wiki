== Project overview ==

HybFS is an _almost_ semantic file system on Linux that can be overlaid on other file systems and provide multiple organizational views of the same original hierarchy of files, without altering the interface for the existing applications. 
This is realized by associating multiple _tags_ with files. A user can create and assign many tags to a file or groups of files containing other tags. The browsing and file operations can be done by using the concept of _virtual_ _directory_. We can think of a virtual directory as a combination of tags, using logic operators like disjunction, conjunction or negation. This will also be known as a _query_.

We mentioned that HybFS is an _almost_ semantic file system, because it actually represents a compromise between the hierarchic and semantic file systems. 


The user can organize files in a hierarchic way, but in the same time can assign tags, or keywords, to the files. In the end the user will have multiple 
This file system comes with two view perspectives to the user:
  # Hierarchic view of the files
  # Semantic view of the files


=== Primary aims ===

For having a basic functionality, we define the following set of aims that must be completed during the allocated time:
 # Implement operations on simple tags and tags with values. A user can create, modify or delete the tags associated to a file.
 # Implement support for queries based on multiple tags.
 # Mount the semantic file system on top of multiple directories (support multiple branches), regardless of the underlying file system(s), thus offering a unified view based on file metadata.
 # Allow operations on sets of files, identified by combinations of tags, also known as queries (for example: delete or move all files corresponding to a query, from the underlying file systems).



=== Secondary aims ===

Having considered the limited time, we established a number of features with a lower priority. Still, these are desirable to have, in order to show the potential of a semantic file system.
 # Add semantic transducers to automatically extract metadata from new files.
 # Add metadata extraction/management policies for each mounted directory/branch, so that new files will be automatically labeled with the set of extracted keywords. As a proof-of-concept, this will be done for MP3 and EXIF metadata.
 # Create a separate application for a user-friendly policy management.
 # Create a set of scripts to automatically index files by adding the corresponding tags to the file system metadata - used for testing.


=== Resources ===
 * FUSE - We decided that for our file system implementation we should use the FUSE API, because it allows a rapid development. Also, we want to allow regular users to mount and configure our file system. 
 * Berkley DB - For storing the associated meta-data we use the Berkley DB, an Open Source embedded database engine that can be linked directly into an application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== HybFS meta-information ==

Each file can be described by using one or multiple tags. A tag represents an additional attribute set by the user. The tags can be simple, or have an associated value.

*Simple tags* are specific keywords added to describe a file. The *attribute-value* tags  are used to granulate even more the description. In this case, the attribute represents the criteria of description and the value is the subcategory. 
Ex: _the file_ *photo1.jpg* _can have as simple tags_ *holiday* _and_ *ski* _, and as attribute-value tags_ *year:2005* _,_ *author:stefania* _and_ *type:jpeg*.

To find the file from the above example, we can specify a path that can be a combination of *holiday* or/and *ski*. To further differentiate between the results of this query, we can also mention the value *2005* for the tag *year* .

In order for the user to have also a hierarchic view, all files in the HybFS have 2 special attribute-value tags:
  * path:file_path (file path without the filename)
  * filename:file_name (the exact file name as in the hierarchic file system)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Semantics of HybFS operations ==

The navigation in HybFS resembles the navigation through a normal hierarchic file system, except the path is in fact a *query* on the tag information associated with the files. From the application point of view, the file system operations remain unchanged when using HybFS. 

=== Query syntax ===

The queries will support the following logic operators:
  * *+* - logic *AND*
  * *|* - logic *OR*
  * *!* - logic *NOT*

Beside logic operators, brackets can be used for more complicated queries.

Ex: *ls '(type:photo + year:2005) + (!ski + !snowboard)'* - will display all files that have the tag *type:photo* and *year:2005*, but they don't have *ski* and *snowboard* tags.

=== Limitations ===

Because a complex query has a certain sintax, the following characters are reserved for describing the possible queries or the tag-associated values:
  * *(*
  * *)*
  * *:*
  * *+*
  * *|*
  * *!*

=== Files/directories operations ===

Our objective here is to keep the same interface as for the hierarchic file system operations and in the same time to seamlessly add semantic operations.

Concerning *navigation*, the system will be *2-Dimensional*:
  * the current path from the hierarchical file system(s)
  * the current virtual folder, which retains the current query

HybFS does not permit file names with *'('* and *')'*, due to complex queries that need brackets. If the path is between brackets, it will be interpreted as a query, otherwise it represents a simple file path relative to the hierarchic file system.


==== File listing ====

All files will be listed based on a query (if a query exists). If there are no semantic queries, the behavior will be the same as in a hierarchic file system.

Example: 
Suppose that we want to list all files  that have the *type:photo* and *year:2005* tags:
{{{ ls (type:photo + year:2005)
}}}
The output will be something like:
{{{ ski/ holiday/ summer/ photoComposition-2005.jpg
}}}
where *ski, holiday* and *summer* are virtual directories and *photoComposition-2005.jpg* is a file. The file *photoComposition-2005.jpg* has only these 2 tags set. But there are files that have the same tags *photoComposition-2005.jpg*, but they also have the tags *holiday*, *summer* or *ski*. These files are grouped in *virtual folders* which have the name of the remaining tags (tags that were not included in the query). 

One of the possible drawbacks of full semantic file systems is that the user doesn't receive any suggestions when navigating through the files and it has to know what is looking for. This was solved by adding virtual folders to refine the results of the navigation. In our example, when we look for files that are *photos* and have been taken in *2005*, we may not know that these files have other tags also and can be filtered even more. Further more, by having this extra information we can discover other files that share the same information/tags as the listed ones.
