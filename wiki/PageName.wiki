= The concept =
HybFS file system is a compromise between the hierarchic and semantic file systems.
The user can organize files in a hierarchic way, but in the same time assign tags to the files.
This file system comes with two view perspectives to the user:
  # Hierarchic view of the files
  # Semantic view of the files

== How is meta-information defined in HybFS ==

Each file can be described using one or multiple tags. A tag is regarded as an attribute for the file. 
Now, the file can be described by two types of tags:
  # Simple tags
  # Attribute-value associations

*Simple tags* are attributes that can be added to describe a file. As for *attribute-vale* tags, they are used to granulate even more the description for a file. The attribute is criteria of description the and the value is the subcategory.

Ex: _the file_ *photo1.jpg* _can have as simple tags_ *holiday* _and_ *ski* _, and as for the attribute-value tags_ *year:2005* _,_ *author:stefania* _and_ *type:jpeg*.

In the example above, the file *photo1.jpg* has 2 simple tags: *holiday* and *ski*. To find this file, the user can search for the files that have *holiday* or *ski* defined as keywords. But, there can a lot of files that have defined as tags *ski* and *holiday*. The file has also defined some _attribute-value_ tags. The first tag, *year:2005* sets an attribute *year* with the value *2005*. This makes it easier for the user to categorize files using tags. Instead of defining only simple tags, he can define simple, clear attributes that permit to differentiate between files.



In order for the user to have also a hierarchic view, all files in the HybFS have 2 special attribute-value tags:
  * path:file_path (file path without the filename)
  * filename:file_name (the exact file name as in the hierarchic file system)

= File operations =

The navigation in HybFS resembles the navigation through a normal hierarchic file system, except the path is in fact a *query* on the tag information associated with the files.
