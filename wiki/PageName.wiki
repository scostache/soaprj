HybFS file system is a compromise between the hierarchic and semantic file systems.
The user can organize files in a hierarchic way, but in the same time assign tags to the files.
This file system comes with two view perspectives to the user:
  # Hierarchic view of the files
  # Semantic view of the files

== How is meta-information defined in HybFS ==

Each file can be described using one or multiple tags. A tag is regarded as an attribute for the file. 
Now, the file can be described by two types of tags:
  # Simple tags
  # Attribute-value associations





In order to accomplish this, all files in the HybFS have 2 special attribute-value tags:
  * path:file_path (file path without the filename)
  * filename:file_name (the exact file name as in the hierarchic file system)

This page contains an accurate description of our semantic file system features that are provided to the user as well as some project design information.
