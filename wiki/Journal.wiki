#summary Short journal of work days
= Introduction =

This will be a short history of each day of work, problems encountered and other implementation related stuff. Each day of work (when I will work) will be detailed here.

Finished the parser using Flex + Bison.
Problem: This is not thread-safe. Wrapping the bison code into a C++ class is not feasible.

== 17 Nov 2008 (Dan) ==

Found Bison++ and Flex++. Bison++ builds a class that represents the parser which implements the grammar. The AST Tree can be now be a member of the class, thus making the parser thread safe.

Discarded this idea too.

Problem: in order to feed *bison++* with the value of the tokens found by *flex++* is necessary to define an _extern_ variable, thus the parser is not *thread-safe*.

== 18  19 Nov 2008 (Dan) ==

Tried *lemon* parser. This is an open-source project developed as part of *sqlite* and continued as a stand alone project.
Unlike bison and flex, where the grammar generator calls the tokenizer (flex), in lemon it's the tokenizer that calls the grammar generator.

In order to be thread-safe I designed a class, *HybFSTokenizer* that represents the tokenizer and feeds the grammar generator.
