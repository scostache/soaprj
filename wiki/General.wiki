=== Coding Style ===

====General stuff====

 * Use 8-space tabs for indentation.
 * Place braces in the Kernighan and Ritchie style. One exception is made for functions: they have the opening brace at the beginning of the next line.
 * Comments: Use "/`*`...`*`/" for commenting. "//" it's just ugly.

===Naming====

=====Structures=====

In our module, structures are defined with typedef, and they have the suffix "`_`t", in general. 

=====Functions=====

 * Function names are lowercase, with underscores to separate words.
 * Macros and enumerations are uppercase.

 * All the main functions from the HybFS core, used for interfacing with FUSE, should be named hybfs`_*` .
 * All the functions that provide access to the BDB (Berkely Database), should be named db`_*` . Some exceptions are possible, when access is needed from functions that are used for other purposes.
 * All the functions that are used for operations on queries (or virtual directories) should be named vdir`_*`.
 * For internal functions within a single source file, a short simple name is acceptable,since they are not globally visible and thus you do not need the module/submodule prefix.

=== Project Hierarchy===

 * bin/   - All the executables from this project should rest here. It's useful when there will be more than one module, each one having it's own directory.
 * doc/   - The documentation for this project: this includes the final paper, and a pdf with all the information presented on this wiki.
 * src/   - Each main module should have it's own directory. All the headers go in the *include/* directory, unless is something really not worth mentioning.
 	* hybfs-core/  - The source files for the filesystem module can be found here.
 	* include/
 * tests/  - Scripts and other applications (if any) designed to test our modules (and our ~~will~~ sanity) should rest in peace under this directory.
