Coding style:

1. General stuff

- Use 8-space tabs for indentation.
- Place braces in the Kernighan and Ritchie style. One exception is made for functions: they
 have the opening brace at the beginning of the next line.
- Comments: Use "/*...*/" for commenting. "//" it's just ugly.

2. Naming

**Structures

In our module, structures are defined with typedef, and they have the suffix "_t", in general. 

**Functions

Function names are lowercase, with underscores to separate words.
Macros and enumerations are uppercase.

All the main functions from the HybFS core, used for interfacing with FUSE, should be named hybfs_* .
All the functions that provide access to the BDB (Berkely Database), should be named db_* . Some 
exceptions are possible, when access is needed from functions that are used for other purposes.
All the functions that are used for operations on queries (or virtual directories) should be named vdir_*.

For internal functions within a single source file, a short simple name is acceptable,since they are
not globally visible and thus you do not need the module/submodule prefix.
