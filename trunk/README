			(-:	About HybFS     :-)


HybFS is an almost semantic file system on Linux that can be overlaid on other file systems
and provide multiple organizational views of the same original hierarchy of files, without 
altering the interface for the existing applications. This is realized by associating multiple
tags with files. A user can create and assign many tags to a file or groups of files containing
other tags. The browsing and file operations can be done by using the concept of virtual directory.
We can think of a virtual directory as a combination of tags, using logic operators like 
disjunction, conjunction or negation. This will also be known as a query.

In a semantic file system, the navigation is based on the additional metadata associated with files,
therefore offering multiple views of the same files. In a hierarchical file system, there is only 
one organizational view of the data, and a file can be identified in a unique way using this view. 
We mentioned that HybFS is an almost semantic file system, because it actually represents a 
compromise between the hierarchic and semantic file systems. The user can organize files in a 
hierarchic way, but in the same time can assign tags, or keywords, to the files.

You can find more details about it on the project home wiki: http://code.google.com/p/soaprj/wiki/HybFS

1.1 Install

	Requirements:

-  FUSE - latest version that we use is 2.7 - http://fuse.sourceforge.net/

-  Boost C++ Libraries 1.37 ( http://www.boost.org/ ).

-  Sqlite3 - the latest version we use is 3.6.6.2 - http://www.sqlite.org/

- Doxygen to generate the documentation.


After that:
	1. set the paths to FUSE, Boost and Sqlite3 in the Makefile (we don't have a configure script yet)

	2. run

	make 

	3. and

	make install

to copy the executables in the ./bin folder and to generate the documentation in doc/.
I didn't added fancy options to copy them somewhere else (not yet - it will come with the configure script).

To clean the mess: 

	make clean


1.2 Mount a directory

	./hybfs dir/ mount_point/

The first parameter is the directory to be overlaid. The parsing is done for multiple directories separated 
with ":" in the hope that sometime in the far future there will be support for multiple directories. 
For now, it can be only one survivor.

Also, you can run ./run_check to check hybfs with valgrind for mem leaks (and errors) - obviously you'll need
valgrind for this :D .

As a method of storing the DB stuff: a directory named .hybfs/ will be created in the wanted branch/directory. Also, 
the tables from the sqlite database are stored in the file .hybfs_main.db from the same folder.



                      )-:    WISH (or what I want from Santa to bring us) List      :-(


What will certainly happen:

- Optimizations to minimize the overhead (which now it's awful) (**urgent**)
- Clean and re-organize the code structure so that it can be separate in libraries -> useful for future use in other
 applications and for porting it to Windows (**urgent**)
- Integrate Berkley DB (back), or add it as an alternative option
- Add support for multiple directories
- Integrate the framework for extracting tags from files - now it'a a separate application

What will possibly happen in a far future:

- Make a nice GUI for our control framework and add friendly options
- Make a nice configure script to install Hybfs in an easy way
